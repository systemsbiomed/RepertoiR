# RepertoiR

Visualization platform for T cell receptor repertoire analysis output results.
It includes comparison of sequence frequency among samples, network of similar
sequences and convergent recombination source between species. Currently 
repertoire analysis is in early stage of development and requires new 
approaches for repertoire data examination and assessment as we intend to 
develop.

## Installation

Direct installation of a recent version is available from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):

``` r
install.packages("RepertoiR")
```

## Quick demo

Creating network graph of TCR repertoire’s clonotypes:

``` r
library(RepertoiR)

aa <- c(
  "G", "A", "V", "L", "I", "P", "F", "Y", "W", "S",
  "T", "N", "Q", "C", "M", "D", "E", "H", "K", "R"
)
data <- matrix(rexp(1 / 2, n = 1000), ncol = 4)
cons <- sample(aa, 10)
aavec <- c()

while (length(aavec) < nrow(data)) {
  aaseq <- cons
  index <- sample(length(aaseq), sample(length(aaseq) / 3, 1))
  aaseq[index] <- sample(aa, length(index), replace = TRUE)
  aaseq <- paste0(aaseq, collapse = "")
  aavec <- unique(append(aavec, aaseq))
}

rownames(data) <- aavec
colnames(data) <- LETTERS[1:ncol(data)]
```

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
