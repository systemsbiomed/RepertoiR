\title{Visualized for CR Sources}
\usage{
cr_source(clone1, clone2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{clone1}{First vector of sequences, string-length is the same for each nucleotide sequence ('A', 'G', 'T', 'C').}

\item{clone2}{Second vector of sequences, same string-length as for the first vector.}

\item{...}{Any other arguments.}
}
\description{
Visualization of Two clones for their convergent recombination (CR) sources. Each sequence (NT) is represented as a colored bar (red for A, yellow for G, blue for T and green for C) linked to its translated amino acid sequence by a colored line, red for the first clone and blue for the second.
}
\examples{
nt <- c("A", "G", "C", "T")
seq_len <- 20
seq_n <- c(15, 19)

# Create data
c1 <- replicate(seq_n[1],
                paste(sample(nt, seq_len, replace = TRUE), collapse = ''))
c2 <- replicate(seq_n[2],
                paste(sample(nt, seq_len, replace = TRUE), collapse = ''))

cr_source(c1, c2)
